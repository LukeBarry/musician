I am given the musician, guitarist, and bassist classes

I must add...

Extend the example code to add a Drummer class. Drummers should be able to solo, count to four, and spontaneously combust.
Then add a Band class. Bands should be able to hire and fire musicians, and have the musicians play their solos after the drummer has counted time.

Drummer class
    super init function to get sounds and solo function
    count to 4 function
    combust function
    
Band class
    list the members in the band
    hire members - add to members list
    fire members - remove from members list
    call the drummer count function and then all musicians play
